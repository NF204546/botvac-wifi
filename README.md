###As a fan of the software framework, solve individual problems and create problems at the same time.

1."void setbothibernate()" solves the problem of not sleeping when installing esp8266 module in Neato botvac.

2."void setbotrecharg()" solves the problem that the Ni-MH battery cannot be recharged periodically after the compulsory sleep of Neato botvac.

Bug: forcing Neato botvac to sleep may cause it not to respond to the clean command of managing web pages.
